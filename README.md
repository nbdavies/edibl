Edibl
=====================
The app that answers the question "Can I eat that?"

## How it works
You use the app to take a photo of something that you're considering ingesting. That photo gets uploaded and added to a central queue. 

Another user, browsing that queue via the app, will make some kind of spot decision about whether what you're looking at is safe to eat. 

Once someone has made a verdict, you'll get a notification on your phone, either telling you to "Go ahead!" or "Don't risk it!". Each photo will get one verdict. 

### Disclaimer
There is no guarantee that the person making the verdict will be any more of an expert than you are, and you in fact have more context available: what are the suroundings like, what does the item smell like, what is its texture. So you are NOT obligated to act on the verdict, nor is Edibl or the other user liable for what happens to you if you ingest something dangerous.

## What Edibl is good for
* Getting a little boost of confidence when trying unfamiliar cuisine
* Potentially identifying safe mushrooms in the wild

## What Edibl is not for
* Faces or other parts of people: we have not designed this app for cannibals.
* Photos of text: this isn't a chat app.
* Pornography: if you want to get your jollies by subjecting others to obscene material, there are better ways to go about it. On this app, your upload will get seen by exactly one person, and then you will likely get banned. Please don't even bother.
* Intentionally ambiguous items: that colorless liquid could be water, or vodka, or bleach. This app does not take the place of common sense and written safety instructions.
* Images that are not photos.

## What is this professional food photography doing in my feed? Why am I seeing a picture of a chair?
We will be partnering with restaurants and other vendors, allowing them to place sponsored images in the app. These will show up in the app just like normal user uploads: no accompanying text saying "Go to Joe's Chicken!", and the photos you see don't necessarily come from the same region as you. The goal of these sponsored images might just be to get you thinking about how delicious thai food is, or how attractive a chair can be, especially when contrasted with badly photographed items of questionable palatability. 

These sponsored images are also objectively "food" or "not food", so your verdict on them gives us a metric on how accurate your ratings are.
